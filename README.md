# Vision Processing
This Python program, built with OpenCV, takes a picture using a webcam and sends the estimated distance (to the lift peg) to the roboRIO.

**Efficiency:** On a Raspberry Pi 2, the whole program takes around 0.3 seconds.

# Requirements
- [ ] Raspberry Pi 2 (or 3) with Raspbian
- [ ] Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 (or any other webcam)
- [ ] Ethernet cable

# Setup
1. Install OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi
    - [How to install OpenCV on RasPi 2](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/26/how-to-install-opencv-3-on-raspbian-jessie/)
    - [How to install OpenCV on RasPi 3](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/)
2. Install [pynetworktables](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/pynetworktables.html) with `pip3 install pynetworktables`
3. Clone this repository
4. Calibrate the webcam so that it takes pictures with low brightness

## Connecting the Raspberry Pi and webcam
1. Connect the webcam to a USB port on the Raspberry Pi
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the router with an Ethernet cable

# How it works
Each line is explained well in `vision-processing.py`, but here is a higher-level overview of the whole process:

1. Take a picture with the camera:
<!-- include picture -->

2. Using HSV, make a map of colors that are greenish:
<!-- include picture -->

3. Find all the contours:
<!-- include picture -->

4. Narrow down the list of contours to the two most likely to be the vision targets on either side of the lift peg:
<!-- include picture -->

5. Based on the schematics of the vision targets, use this formula to find the distance from the camera to the vision target:
    - `distance = targetHeight * resY / (pixelHeight * tan(viewAngleY))`
        - `targetHeight = 5` (in inches)
        - `resY = 480` (the Microsoft Lifecam is 640x480)
        - `pixelHeight` is the height of an LED peg vision target contour
        - `viewAngleY = 34.3Â°` (for the Microsoft Lifecam)
            - If you are using a different webcam, you can check [this page](http://vrguy.blogspot.com/2013/04/converting-diagonal-field-of-view-and.html) to find your webcam's vertical FOV from its diagonal FOV and aspect ratio (usually found in the webcam's specifications)

6. Send the data (distance) to the roboRIO using NetworkTables (TODO)

Pixel height: 152px, 23.2 in., Actual distance: 23.6 in

<!-- Make a list of original pictures and their corresponding end contours. Also include difficult pictures with contours split by an obstruction -->

# TODO
- [ ] Send the distance data to the roboRIO using NetworkTables
- [ ] **Make vision still be accurate with a tilted viewpoint**
- [ ] Make everything more efficient
- [ ] Make everything more readable
- [ ] Add more explanation and images to this README
- [ ] Add more examples to README
